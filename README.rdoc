App for managing my librarly, segregating books, finding where they are exactly (shelf and rack) with an aim of creating an easy to use
yet complex and fast search engine that will update the results live (after search, no page reload, just reload of the table with results).

Based on simple stack from (Roda-Sequel-Stack)[https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda-sequel-stack].
Ruby 3.0.1

elm make src/Main.elm --output assets/js/MainElm.js

For now a simple elm integration. compile and then rackup
